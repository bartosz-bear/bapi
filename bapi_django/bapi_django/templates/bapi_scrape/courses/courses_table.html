<p>And there you have it. Imagine how much time it would take to collect this data by hand. If you are quick with your mouse, it would take you probably about 30 seconds
for one course to copy-paste this information to your Excel. You would need 30 minutes of labor work to collect information about 60 courses. It takes 5-10 seconds
with web scraping. And another good thing, web scraping scales really well - it doesn't matter if you collect 60 courses, 600 or 6000, it would take about the same 5-10
seconds to collect.</p>
