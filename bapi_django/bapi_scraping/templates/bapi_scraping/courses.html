            <h2>Welcome to 'Extract' section!</h2><br>

            In the 'Extract' section I'm going to demonstrate different ways I can help your organization collect data from multiple sources.<br><br>

            We are going to start with Web Scraping.<br><br>

            Web scraping is a technique which you can use to substitute manual process of collecting useful information from websites and web platforms. At the end of this article, I'm going to show you an example of web scraping
            converting a 30 minutes, fully manual process of collecting data from internet into a 5-10 seconds fully automated process.<br><br>
            
            Web scraping allows you to collect data from very small and very large websites (think Amazon, Twitter, Facebook). If you can see information displayed in your browser this information can be downloaded and saved in
            the format most suitable and actionable for YOU. This includes platforms which require authentication (provided that you have authentication of course).<br><br>
            
            When companies create their websites they have to take two somehow conflicting interests into consideration. They design their user interfaces so they can maximize their revenues in a way which is still fairly
            convenient for the user. At least in theory. Some people may argue that companies care about their own interest only. Ok, we are not here to argue. Either way, we would all agree that modern websites have many annoying
            components like pop-ups, advertisements, displaying high-margin promotional offers on top, registration forms, chat bots, etc. These tools are supposed to convert or persuade us to buy more.

            What if I could tell you that you could switch off all these annoying distractors and still collect exactly the same data from the website? That's where web scraping comes handy.<br><br>
            
            Web scraping allows you to get the same data, from the same sources but in the format which is THE MOST USEFUL AND ACTIONABLE FOR YOU. In the next paragraphs I will show you how data can be collected through web
            scraping and put in a table format which can very easily be downloaded into Excel, or stored in a database.<br><br>
          <div>

            <h2>Let's see scraping in action</h2><br>

          Ok, we are going to take one of the most popular websites for online courses called <b>'Coursera'.</b> The company was founded in 2012 by two leading researchers of Machine Learning and AI,
          Stanford University professor Andrew Ng, and Daphne Koller. Coursera provides a range of high qualify courses provided by top universities around the world as well as the top tech companies like Gooogle, IBM and Microsoft.

          <br></br>

          Let's imagine that you are a researcher working for a company who would like to analyze popularity and quality of online courses in data science field. You want to create an Excel spreadsheet which contains ALL available
          courses in Coursera. 

          In this case, you would visit <a href="https://www.coursera.org/browse/data-science" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.coursera.org</a>, choose the category data science and see what courses are available in this category.
          
          

          <br></br>

          Below we can see a snaphot of some of the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/browse/data-science" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coursera</a> courses available in the Data Science domain.

          You can realize immediately that the user interface is not showing what you expected. Instead of presenting a list of all available courses, it's displaying some deliberately filtered courses or programs. They are most likely
          the courses, THEY would like you to take the most. Not what you really want. As I said before, websites' interfaces are NOT REALLY DESIGNED FOR YOU. They are design to serve the website's owner interest, but still in
          a subtle way so you don't leave immediately.
        
        </div>

        <br>

        <div class="box">

            {% load static %}
            <img src="{% static 'course_categories3.png' %}" alt="Course Categories">

          </div>           

          <div>

            <br>

          For each course in the 'Data Science' category we would like to collect 'Name of the Instructor', 'Number of Ratings', 'Number of Students Enrolled' and 'Full Description' of the course. If we were to collect these
          information manually, we would have to visit each course page separately. This would take a lot of time. And this is where scraping comes handy. The script will visit each course page, collect the requested information
          and save everything to SQL database for further use.

        </div>
          <br>

          <div class="box">


          {% load static %}
          <img src="{% static 'course_info2.png' %}" class="box.img" alt="Course Categories">
    


        </div>

          <hr>

          Let's see how it works in practice.

          <br>

          <br>

          Choose a category and press 'Submit'. Be patient, it takes between 5-10 seconds to collect for information about all courses.
